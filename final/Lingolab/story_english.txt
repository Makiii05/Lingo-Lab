Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, the humid air of the afternoon hanging heavy and still, promising nothing but drowsiness. She had nothing to do, a state she found acutely irritating, especially since her sister's book offered no visual or conversational distraction. "What is the use of a book," she mused, adjusting her position, "without pictures or conversations?"

She was deep in a mild, sleepy debate with herself—weighing the slight pleasure of forming a daisy-chain against the monumental effort of rising and gathering the flowers—when a completely unexpected event occurred: a White Rabbit with striking pink eyes bolted past her. She barely registered it at first, even when she heard the distinct, worried voice of the creature muttering, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” It was the very next moment, however, that jolted Alice from her torpor. The Rabbit, with an air of profound urgency, produced a watch from a hidden pocket in its waistcoat, checked the time with an anxious flick of its ears, and hurried on. The sheer absurdity—a talking rabbit wearing clothes and consulting a timepiece—ignited Alice’s curiosity like a match. She scrambled to her feet and chased it across the field, arriving just in time to see it vanish down a surprisingly large rabbit-hole tucked beneath a hedge.

Without a second thought for the practicalities of escape, Alice plunged headlong after it. The rabbit-hole started as a straight tunnel but then pitched down violently, transforming into an impossibly deep well. Alice found herself in a slow, dreamlike fall. The air was cool, giving her ample time to observe the sides of the shaft, which were strangely fitted out with familiar, domestic objects: cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and pictures hanging from pegs. As she drifted past one shelf, she grabbed a jar labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” only to find it disappointing empty. Careful not to endanger anyone below, she neatly tucked the empty jar back into a passing cupboard.

Her mind, despite the extraordinary circumstances, remained practical and surprisingly self-congratulatory. She thought of the thrill her fall would cause at home: "After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home!" The fall seemed endless, prompting her to use her schoolroom knowledge to calculate her approximate location. "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. That would be four thousand miles down, I think..." Then, she moved on to more fanciful geographical concerns, wondering about the "Antipathies"—the people who walk with their heads downward—and how she might politely inquire if she had landed in New Zealand or Australia.

Eventually, with nothing else to occupy her, her thoughts drifted to her cat, Dinah. She worried that her family might forget the cat's saucer of milk and longed for the feline company. Just as she was beginning to doze off, dreaming of asking Dinah a very earnest question about the consumption of bats, she landed with a sudden, soft thump! onto a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Unhurt, Alice jumped up. The way back was dark, but ahead of her stretched a long passage down which the White Rabbit was still fleeting. She ran, catching the urgent, final lament of the Rabbit as it rounded a bend: “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” Alice followed, but the eccentric, clock-watching creature was gone.

The man who chronicled this incredible adventure, Dr. John Watson, had another companion of equally obsessive brilliance: Sherlock Holmes. Watson’s narration shifts dramatically, introducing the one woman who could truly challenge the great detective’s legendary reserve: Irene Adler. To Holmes, she was simply, universally, "the" woman. Watson emphasizes that this distinction was not rooted in any romantic affection—emotions, especially love, were abhorrent to the detective's mind, which was "cold, precise but admirably balanced."

Holmes was, in Watson’s view, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine the world had ever produced. He held the softer passions in contempt, viewing them only as useful tools for an observer to uncover human motives. To allow such emotional intrusions into his own "delicate and finely adjusted temperament" would be catastrophic—like placing grit in a sensitive instrument or cracking one of his own high-power lenses. Yet, Irene Adler, a woman of "dubious and questionable memory," held a singular, inexplicable power over his intellect.

Watson admits his recent estrangement from Holmes, his own life having been pleasantly consumed by the joys of marriage and the establishment of his own home. Meanwhile, Holmes, the quintessential Bohemian soul who loathed all forms of society, remained rooted in their Baker Street lodgings. There, amidst his old books, he maintained a stark, volatile rhythm, "alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition."

In a completely different part of the world, on the sprawling, sun-baked plains of Kansas, lived Dorothy. She was in the care of her Uncle Henry, a hard-working farmer, and Aunt Em, his wife. Their home was necessarily small, a simple, one-room box constructed from lumber that had to be hauled for many miles across the prairie. It contained only the bare essentials: a cooking stove, a cupboard, a table, a few chairs, and the beds.

The landscape was vast and unforgiving. There were no trees and no neighboring houses; the gray prairie stretched unbroken to the horizon in every direction. The relentless sun had scorched the land, turning the plowed soil into a cracked, uniform gray mass. Even the long blades of grass were faded to the same desaturated color.

Aunt Em had once been a young and pretty wife, but the harsh environment had stripped her of her vitality. The sun and wind had drained the sparkle from her eyes, leaving them a dull, sober gray. The red was gone from her cheeks and lips, which were now also gray. She had become thin, gaunt, and perpetually solemn, having seemingly forgotten how to smile. When Dorothy, an orphan, first came to live with them, Aunt Em was so profoundly startled by the sound of the child's laughter that it brought her to tears. She would press her hand to her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears. Uncle Henry was a man equally devoid of outward joy, working tirelessly from dawn until dusk, yet his love for Dorothy remained a quiet, steadfast truth.
